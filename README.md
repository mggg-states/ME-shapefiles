# Maine Election Shapefiles
This shapefile was obtained from the Maine Geolibrary website and processed by students in Diana Davis' Redistricting REU at Swarthmore College.

## Sources
The Maine precinct shapefile was obtained from the [Maine Geolibrary](https://www.maine.gov/geolib/catalog.html), a GIS service of the State of Maine. Election data come from the [Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections, & Commissions](https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html). 2010 Decennial Census demographic data were downloaded from the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1). The 2010 census block shapefile for Maine was downloaded from the US Census Bureau’s [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html).


## Processing
Some very limited merging of precincts in the tabular election data and precinct shapefile were necessary to join election results to precinct boundaries. Data from absentee votes reported at the state level were disaggregated by voting age population. Because of data reporting and processing, a few precincts cross county boundaries. Demographic data were aggregated from the block level using MGGG’s proration software. Congressional and state legislative district IDs were also assigned to precincts using this package.
